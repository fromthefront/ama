# Ask us anything!

From the Front is the no-profit organisation taking care of the homonymous [conference series](http://lanyrd.com/series/fromthefront/).

Feel free to [ask](../../issues/new) anything, and we mean it: conference related, team related, personal stuff. whatever.

#### [Ask a new question](../../issues/new)
#### [Read the answers](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been [answered](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) or [asked](../../issues).
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Make sure you are nice to each other ([Long version](code-of-conduct.md))

## Optimization

We hope all answers can help other people on related or identical questions in the future. 
In order to optimize readability and SEO, administrators might modify or revise closed issues.

However, if you do not feel comfortable about this, leave a message and it will not be modified (and any change for this purpose will be reverted).
